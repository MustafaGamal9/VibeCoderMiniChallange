# Hero Section ‚Äì Vibe Coder Mini Challenge

A reusable Angular component creating a beautiful and functional Hero Section for an e-learning website. This component features inline text editing, simulated AI content regeneration with local storage persistence, and a responsive design, built as part of the Vibe Coder Mini Challenge.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Core Hero Elements:** Includes a headline, subheadline, Call-to-Action (CTA) button, and an illustrative image.
*   **Inline Text Editing:** Click directly on the headline or subheadline to edit the text in place. Edits are captured using the `(input)` event for frequent saving.
*   **Local Storage Persistence:** User's text edits and the last viewed content index are saved in the browser's `localStorage` and persist across sessions.
*   **Simulated AI Regeneration:** A "Regenerate with AI" button randomly swaps the headline, subheadline, and image from predefined local lists. It prevents the exact same item from appearing twice consecutively.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
